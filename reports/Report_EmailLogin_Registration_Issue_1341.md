## 📋 Executive Summary
A comprehensive manual test of the Email/Password Login flow, User Registration flow, and Dashboard navigation was executed across multiple screen sizes (Desktop and Mobile viewports). 
While both flows are functional and successfully integrate with the database, **six distinct bugs/UX regression issues** were identified that significantly degrade the mobile experience, visual branding, and user identity presentation.

## 🔍 Bug Logs (Identified Issues)

Below are the detailed reports of the 6 bugs identified during manual testing:

### 🚨 Bug 1: Missing "Sign Up" Button in Mobile Viewport
* **Component:** Global Header / Navigation Bar
* **Description:** On mobile screen widths, only the "Login" button is visible in the header area. The "Sign Up" button is completely hidden, forcing mobile users to manually guess or type the registration path to sign up.
* **Impact:** **High** — Limits user growth and degrades registration rates on mobile.
* **Evidence:** 
  * *Desktop Nav (Both Present):* [bug4(login and signup present in larger screens only)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcacbe6c-4cdc-4a21-956c-0de3afbf5da9)
  * *Mobile Nav (Sign Up Missing):* [mobilescreen(only login button)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3eaaa1f-99ed-40f0-84fc-de047bbfd829)

---

### 🚨 Bug 2: Generic "Invalid Email" Login Error
* **Component:** Login Form Feedback / UX
* **Description:** When trying to log in with a valid email address that does not exist in the database, the system displays a generic `"Invalid email"` error. It should ideally notify the user that no account is associated with that email and suggest creating one.
* **Impact:** **Medium** — Sub-optimal UX. Does not guide unregistered users toward the registration flow.
* **Evidence:** [bug1(valid-email)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d16db73b-3e76-4ae1-ab40-d6e123c42bf0)

---

### 🚨 Bug 3: Email Prefix Used as Dashboard Display Name
* **Component:** Freelancer Dashboard Welcome Message (`/app/freelancer/dashboard`)
* **Description:** After logging in, the dashboard welcomes the user with the prefix of their email address (e.g., `"Welcome back, shoxgun123!"`) instead of rendering their actual profile username (`shogun444`) or professional Display Name.
* **Impact:** **Medium** — Breaks professional customization and custom identity across user portals.
* **Evidence:** [bug2(shows-doesnt show username in dashboard)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a0978e-3674-469f-8c45-52cfb0cefa13)

---

### 🚨 Bug 4: Global Navbar Avatar Desync
* **Component:** Profile Settings Photo & Global Navbar Avatar
* **Description:** Uploading a custom profile image (e.g. Garou custom avatar) correctly persists and displays on the Profile Settings page. However, the global Header Navigation Bar avatar fails to sync and continues showing a simple letter circle (`S` in this case).
* **Impact:** **Medium** — Broken visual integration that degrades the premium look of the web application.
* **Evidence:** [bug3(updating photo on profile doesn't change the image on nav)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76427928-ca3c-4972-9d17-7f601246fc11)

---

### 🚨 Bug 5: Non-Functional Navigation Menu/Drawer on Mobile Viewports
* **Component:** Mobile Responsive Hamburger Menu Modal
* **Description:** Clicking or tapping the hamburger button (`☰` icon in the top left) on mobile viewport sizes does not open the navigation drawer or modal to switch routes (Dashboard, Marketplace, FAQ, Help), rendering mobile navigation impossible.
* **Impact:** **Critical** — Mobile users are locked out of basic page-to-page navigation.
* **Evidence:** [bug6(the model to change routes does open)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79808900-6b72-499f-9a8f-9ed76fbdf8e0)

---

### 🚨 Bug 6: False-Positive Notification Badge (Active Badge with '0' Notifications)
* **Component:** Global Header Notification Bell Icon
* **Description:** The header's notification bell displays an active, bright red badge containing the number `0`. Standard UI patterns dictate that badges should only appear or be colored red when there is at least `1` unread notification, to prevent false alarms.
* **Impact:** **Low/Medium** — Confuses users into thinking they have unread messages or notifications when they have none.
* **Evidence:** [Screenshot 2026-05-30 194005](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4c92556-a6e6-429d-9c8f-d708e4597b31)

## 🛠️ Next Steps & Core Recommendations

1. **Fix Header Mobile Navigation (Bugs 1 & 5):** 
   - Integrate standard responsive Tailwind/CSS breakpoints inside header navigation so that "Sign Up" button behaves correctly on smaller screens.
   - Attach functional toggle click listeners to the hamburger button (`☰`) in React to toggle drawer visibility.

2. **Fix Dashboard User Context (Bug 3):**
   - Locate dashboard rendering view and replace the email string parsing logic with user context profile data (`user.username` or `user.displayName`).

3. **Fix Global State Sync for Avatar (Bug 4):**
   - Use a shared state context or react query refetch trigger on profile update mutations so that the navigation header updates instantaneously alongside the settings form.

4. **Correct Notification Component Badge logic (Bug 6):**
   - Hide or mute the badge color conditional on `notificationCount > 0` instead of unconditionally rendering the red circle.
